### `Todo App using React JS and Material UI`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### `Instructions to run project in your system : `

**Note: I have used jsonserver in this project to create a fake backend so follow this steps as it is mentioned.**
1). Open project through terminal and run command `npm install` to install all dependencies of the project.
2). Install Json-server globally to run project through fake backend. Command to install json-server `npm install -g json-server`.
3). Use this command `json-server --watch data/data.json --port 8000` to run fake backend for the project. This command actually starts your fake backend server and allows to hit apis on port `8000` that we mentioned in command.
4). Open another terminal and run command `npm start` to run this react Todo project
